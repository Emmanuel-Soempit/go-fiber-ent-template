## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Go 1.16 or later
- Air for automatic compilation (optional)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-remote-try-go.git
   cd my-go-app
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```
   go mod tidy
   ```

### Running the Application

To run the application, use the following command:

```
go run cmd/main.go
```

If you have Air installed, you can run:

```
air
```

This will start the application and automatically reload it when changes are made.

### Usage

Once the application is running, you can access it at `http://localhost:3000`. You can send requests to the defined routes and see how the application handles them.
